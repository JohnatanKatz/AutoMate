# AutoMate

A user friendly automation program. That currently includes:
* Exact Image recognitions, for clicking on buttons.
* Switching between windows.
* Setting a macro to type text, or automate clicks on specific screen locations.
* Save/load.

## Installation

Download the latest release from the releases tab, extract and run the executable.
*Video guide on usage coming soon.

## Usage/Examples

You can use it to automate repeatable tasks in programs or websites that don't allow it. For example:
* Automating long login processes.
* Unfollowing everything on facebook to regain control of your feed.
* Opening all the program you need to start your work day, in a single click.
* Downloading a mod collection via nexus mod manager.

Some example saves will come soon, to help you get started.

## Caveats

Considering its a prototype, there are a few caveats:
* It can only be used on Windows.
* The simple UI library I picked is limited, preventing user friendly features and causing lag when resizing the window.
* There's going to be bugs, if you find one, I'd be thankful if you reported it.

## Motivation

With the large growth of business automation tools, I've always  been suprised by the lack of user friendly tools built for the average person.
Even though the target audience might be small, I believe they still deserve the ability to save time, frustration, and be able to jump over the growing complexity of applications that used to be user friendly.

## Next Steps

* Extending the applications features.
* Changing UI library to a more robust one. Allowing better features, design and no lag.
* Adding some AI based image recognition for none exact matches.
